# Multi-App Elm and Deploy to Github Pages

This is a test project, so different webapps can be written in elm and deployed to Github Pages.

Most of the information is thanks to this repo: <https://github.com/isaacvando/elm-to-gh-pages>

The process is simple, the page sources are compiled separately into a build directory, then that build directory is deployed to pages.

In the `src` directory, a subdirectory labelled `root` is taken as the root for the pages website.

There are additional steps I wish to take but this works for now.
